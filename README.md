   The code generates 2D/3D, smooth/fluctuating 
   initial profile using MC Glauber model which 
   can be used in hydro codes for evolution.

   eccentricity is calculated assuming two component energy deposition with
   xhard in MC Glauber model .


   // how to simulate
   1. Set input parameters in file "input.md".
   2. [command in terminal] make clean
   3. [command in terminal] make 
   4. [command in terminal] ./mc_glauber < no. of events want to generate>  <input.md>
